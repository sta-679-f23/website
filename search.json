    "text": "Diversity & Inclusiveness\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Wake Forest records, please let me know!\nIf any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it."

The labs will also provide you with tools that you will need to complete the project successfully. You are welcome to work on these with other members of this class. If you do so, please acknowledge your collaborator(s) at the top of your assignment, for example: “Collaborators: Gertrude Cox, Florence Nightingale David”. Failure to acknowledge collaborators will result in a grade of 0. You may not copy answers directly from another student. If you copy someone else’s work, both parties will receive a grade of 0.\n\n\nCheck-ins\nWe will periodically have assessments to check in with our learning goals."
